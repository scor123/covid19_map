# covid19_map

This project is about creating a covid 19 visualization map, the data used in this project is a data set contains the infections numbers, I used the data to map the countries and to get the top 15 countries with the biggest infection rate, the project created by HTML, CSS, python, and flask framework. 
this project could be helpful with one small edit, instead of using a data file, I had an idea about linking the app with the official Covid19 platform like WHO dashboard and scrap the data and update my map automatically.
